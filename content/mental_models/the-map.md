A map of reality is not reality. They are reductions of what they represent.

Alfred Korzybski, a mathematician in New Orleans, published a paper in 1931 where he stated _the map is not the territory_. Meaning, the description of the thing is not the thing itself. The model is not reality. 

**Map = any abstraction of reality, including descriptions, theories, models**

Our mind creates maps of reality in order to understand it, and frequently we don't understand our maps or their limits. We often use incorrect models because any model is better than no model.

> Deviations of the past may not be deviations of the future.

> You do not understand a model, map, or reduction unless you understand and respect its limitations

Example. Using historical financial data to make predictions about the future. 

Lesson Learned: Know that maps can be wrong.
